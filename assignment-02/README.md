# Assignment 2
## Multimedia Programming II (MMP 310)

Spring 2017

Instructor: Roy Vanegas

## Description
This assignment is designed to get you practicing some basic Git commands. Consider pushing/syncing often, perhaps after every commit.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Using your command line interface, create a branch called `assignment-02--<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>`, replacing `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` with your own GitHub username. (Go to [https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/) to learn how to create branches using GitHub Desktop).
        git checkout -b assignment-02--<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>
3. Switch into that new branch:
        git checkout assignment-02--<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>
4. Compile the CSS in this repository via Sass, then commit the change.
5. Visit the [jQuery CDN](https://code.jquery.com/) and add the jQuery library to the tail of the `<body>` element, before the `<script>` tag, in `index.html`. When you’re done, commit.
6. Change the opacity of the `animate` method from `0.3` to `0.5`, then commit.
7. Change the duration of the `animate` method from 2 seconds to 1 second, then commit.
8. Update the `<title>` element to include your name. For example, I would change `Assignment 2` to `Assignment 2 | Roy Vanegas`. When you’re done, commit.
9. Add a rule in `sass/style.scss` that makes the background color of the body `#eee`, then commit.
